[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy-meta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy-meta)

## Overview
This is a meta repository to assemble all repositories required for a PKS + NSX-T deployment on vSphere.

You likely really want to be looking at the [vmware-pks-deploy](https://github.com/vmware/vmware-pks-deploy) project.

Do not clone this repository. Instead, [install Git Repo](https://source.android.com/source/downloading#installing-repo).

Once you've installed Git Repo, you will use it to download and assemble all the component git repositories.

This processis as follows:
* create and/or change into a directory where you'd like to place all source relevant to this PKS deployment
* then execute the following

`repo init -u git@github.com:vmware/vmware-pks-deploy-meta.git`

...followed by...

`repo sync`
